# SimpliLearn_SQL_Projects
This is where I will be posting any and all SQL projects undertaken whilst completing my SimpliLearn course.

The first project completed involves filtering and altering employee information for a fictitious company.
The objectives, datasets, code, and results can all be found within this repository.
